## Introduction 
  The place where I work we have a voucher system also we want to improve reducing the paper to have a better control and managment. It make a inventory where all the voucher storage into a DataBase with that in mind could be more faster to find a especific voucher, without searching in all the papers that we have.
## Purpose
  This project is based on a paper problem where the records that are carried out on paper, it is very easy to lose these records or fill them in an erroneous way, so create a web page where the vouchers are registered and accommodate a simple form and by date where it will maintain an order and better management of internal control and of the borrowed objects.
## Scope
  The control of Voucher is a web application that helps to have a better organization when creating vouchers. it will have specifications such as name, registration number, date, loan tools and the room that was provided. Must have this information to be stored in a different area but before being stored. it must be reviewed by the system and the system will be the one that will choose in what area it will stay if in the "voucher area without observations" or in the "voucher area with observations".
  
this web application has to be connected with a database where all the vouchers will be stored, which is localted on a web-server

## Overview
 #### Product Perpective
  This system will consist in two part one of them is the web application where all the vouchers that we make are storage and the other   is where all the voucher gonna storage and that it's located into a database.
 #### Product Functions
  the web application .- has to get the registers from the client.
  the data base.- has to have all the ended vouchers.
 #### User Characteristics
  in this part we'll have some actor that are involucrate in this software.
  
| actors | description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Client | it's the person who gonna ask for the materials |
|  Employee  | the employee it's the person who gonna filled the digital voucher with all the record from the customer  |
| Administrator | person who administrate the software and care thet everything is okay with all the functions |

 #### Constraints
  one of the constraints that I see is we have three windows and only one computer in it, so this could be the main
  barely the old computer that we have could be also a problem, when we are filling the data.
  all the tools doesn't have a number registration for know how much we have in the inventory also the internet we need to make more       large. 
 #### Assumptions and dependencies
 | Assumptions(AS) and dependencies(DE) | description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| AS.-1 | only one employee use the software per machine |
| AS.-2 | just a client it will be attended |
| DE.-1 | internet connection |
| DE.-2 | bad performance of the computer and end the system |
 #### Apportioning of requirements

## Specific Requirements 
 #### User Interfaces
    in the moment they or we use for the first time we have our web application where it has different sections but first at all we have to choose the button to create a new digital voucher then the employee he/she gather the information from the customer that everything he/she wants and pulled into the digital voucher
